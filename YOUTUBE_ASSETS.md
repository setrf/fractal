**Option 1 (Hook-focused)**:
"Fractal: The AI Engine That Thinks in Questions"

**Option 2 (Descriptive)**:
"Fractal - Self-Improving Discovery Engine (WeaveHacks 3 Submission)"

**Option 3 (Intriguing)**:
"Why Search for Answers When You Can Discover Questions? | Fractal Demo"

## Video Description

Fractal is an infinite curiosity engine built for WeaveHacks 3. It fundamentally inverts the search paradigm: instead of finding answers, it helps you discover better questions.

🔗 **Try it here**: [Link to Repo/Demo]
🧠 **Built with**: W&B Weave, W&B Inference, Llama 3.1
🚀 **Event**: WeaveHacks 3 (San Francisco)

### What plays in this video:
0:00 The "Seed": Starting with a simple question ("Why do we yawn?")
0:20 The 3D Graph: Visualizing knowledge with force-directed physics
0:50 The Stash: Collecting key insights (Brain Cooling vs. Social Empathy)
1:20 The Probe: Synthesizing a unified theory using Llama 3.1
1:45 The Tech: Self-improving agent loop via W&B Weave

### How it works:
Fractal uses a "Self-Improving Loop" that treats prompt engineering as an optimization problem. Every time it generates questions, an LLM Judge scores the quality of the output. Using W&B Weave traces, the system automatically updates its probability weights to favor the prompt strategies that yield the most insightful questions over time.
