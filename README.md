# Fractal

A place for questions, not answers.

## Vision

In a world full of answer engines—Google, LLMs, ChatGPT—there's no place designed for **questions**. Fractal is an interactive interface for creative exploration of curiosity. Enter a question, and watch it branch into related sub-questions, creating an infinite mind-map of inquiry.

## Design Philosophy

- **Swiss Neobrutalist UI** — Hard edges, bold borders, functional over decorative
- **Monochromatic OKLCH System** — Zero chromatic colors in core UI, only grayscale
- **IBM Terminal Aesthetic** — Monospace typography, stark contrast
- **Distraction-free** — The interface disappears; your questions remain

## Tech Stack

- React 18 + Vite
- TypeScript
- CSS Modules with OKLCH color tokens

## Getting Started
